              <br />
              To create a CAD model datum:
              <br />
              Before modeling, you need to create some basic geometry shapes, such
              as planes, circles, rectangles, etc., as a reference and aid for
              subsequent modeling.
              <br />
              Choose how you want to model:
              <br />
              According to the design requirements, select the appropriate
              modeling method. Common CAD modeling methods include:
              <br />
              Solid modeling: for objects with well-defined geometries.
              <br />
              Curve modeling: It is suitable for the modeling of complex curves.
              <br />
              Patch modeling: Suitable for objects with a large amount of surface
              detail
              <br />
              Perform CAD assembly and motion analysis:
              <br />
              If the product consists of multiple parts, the assembly function of
              the CAD software can be used to place the parts in the correct
              position and assemble them. At the same time, motion analysis can be
              performed to simulate the deformation, stress, and collision of the
              product during movement.
              <br />
              CAD Drawing and Documentation:
              <br />
              Once the modeling is complete, 2D drawings and sections are created
              using the drawing capabilities of the CAD software, and the modeling
              process is documented

            In Fusion 360, you can use the McMester-Carr parts library to find and
            insert various mechanical components, including motors and steering
            gears. Please follow the following steps:
            <br />
            <br />
            1. **Click &quot;Insert&quot; &gt; &quot;Insert McMaster-Carr
            parts.&quot; ** (You can see this option in your screenshot).
            <br />
            <br />
            2. In the pop-up McMaster-Carr browser window, search for the type of
            motor or steering gear you need. For example, you can search for
            &quot;DC motor&quot;, &quot;servo motor&quot;, &quot;gear motor&quot;
            and so on. The search function of McMaster-Carr is very powerful. You
            can filter according to various parameters, such as size, voltage,
            speed, torque, etc.
            <br />
            <br />
            3. Choose the right model. Browse the search results and find the
            motor or steering gear model that meets your needs.
            <br />
            <br />
            4. Configuration model parameters (optional). Some models allow you to
            configure some parameters, such as the length of the shaft, the
            location of the installation hole, etc.
            <br />
            <br />
            5. Click &quot;Insert&quot;. This will insert the selected motor or
            steering gear model into your Fusion 360 design.

            Automated Modeling  quickly generates design alternatives for
            connecting existing geometries in your design. Adding one of the
            alternatives to your design, creates a parametric, solid body that is
            editable using the Timeline.
            <br />
            Using Automated Modeling speeds up the modeling process by suggesting
            different geometrical shapes that you can use to complete your design,
            or that you can use as inspiration for a final design.

            Features:
            <br />
            Multiple modeling tools: C4D offers a wide range of modeling tools,
            including polygon modeling, NURBS modeling, sculpting, and volume
            modeling, enabling users to create complex 3D models.
            <br />
            Powerful animation features: Keyframe animation, character animation,
            physics simulation, dynamics, and more are supported to easily create
            natural and smooth animation effects.
            <br />
            Advanced Rendering Engine: Produces photorealistic renderings with
            support for effects such as physical rendering, global illumination,
            ambient occlusion, and global reflections.
            <br />
            Rich material and texture libraries: Users can use preset materials or
            create custom materials to enhance the look of their models.
            <br />
            Simulation and Dynamic Simulation: Support a variety of simulations,
            such as cloth simulation, liquid simulation, smoke simulation, and
            fragmentation simulation, to add realism and dynamics to the scene.
            <br />
            Particle and Effect Systems: Supports the creation and control of
            particle systems, simulates effects such as fire, explosions,
            raindrops, and more, and provides a variety of special effect tools.
            <br />
            Plug-in and scripting interfaces: It has an open plug-in and scripting
            interface, allowing users to extend the functionality of the software
            by installing plug-ins or writing custom scripts.

            Technical Background:
            <br />
            Formerly known as FastRay software released in 1989, C4D was
            originally released on the Amiga platform, later renamed CINEMA 4D,
            and continues to be updated and enhanced in multiple versions.
            <br />
            With the continuous development of technology, C4D has become the
            software of choice for many excellent artists and film companies, and
            is widely used in advertising, film, industrial design and other
            fields.
            <br />
            Version Updates:
            <br />
            C4D 2024, for example, brings modeling improvements, powerful
            enhancements to the new unified simulation system, significant
            additions to the node editor, and the Redshift renderer as the default
            renderer, significantly improving the performance and efficiency of
            the software.
            <br />
            Application Cases:
            <br />
            C4D is prominent in all kinds of movies depicted and is valued by more
            and more film companies. At the same time, its application is also
            widely involved in advertising, industrial design and other fields,
            providing strong technical support for creators.
