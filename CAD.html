      <br />
      To create a CAD model datum:
      <br />
      Before modeling, you need to create some basic geometry shapes, such as
      planes, circles, rectangles, etc., as a reference and aid for subsequent
      modeling.
      <br />
      Choose how you want to model:
      <br />
      According to the design requirements, select the appropriate modeling
      method. Common CAD modeling methods include:
      <br />
      Solid modeling: for objects with well-defined geometries.
      <br />
      Curve modeling: It is suitable for the modeling of complex curves.
      <br />
      Patch modeling: Suitable for objects with a large amount of surface detail
      <br />
      Perform CAD assembly and motion analysis:
      <br />
      If the product consists of multiple parts, the assembly function of the CAD
      software can be used to place the parts in the correct position and assemble
      them. At the same time, motion analysis can be performed to simulate the
      deformation, stress, and collision of the product during movement.
      <br />
      CAD Drawing and Documentation:
      <br />
      Once the modeling is complete, 2D drawings and sections are created using
      the drawing capabilities of the CAD software, and the modeling process is
      documented

      In Fusion 360, you can use the McMester-Carr parts library to find and
      insert various mechanical components, including motors and steering gears.
      Please follow the following steps:
      <br />
      <br />
      1. **Click &quot;Insert&quot; &gt; &quot;Insert McMaster-Carr parts.&quot;
      ** (You can see this option in your screenshot).
      <br />
      <br />
      2. In the pop-up McMaster-Carr browser window, search for the type of motor
      or steering gear you need. For example, you can search for &quot;DC
      motor&quot;, &quot;servo motor&quot;, &quot;gear motor&quot; and so on. The
      search function of McMaster-Carr is very powerful. You can filter according
      to various parameters, such as size, voltage, speed, torque, etc.
      <br />
      <br />
      3. Choose the right model. Browse the search results and find the motor or
      steering gear model that meets your needs.
      <br />
      <br />
      4. Configuration model parameters (optional). Some models allow you to
      configure some parameters, such as the length of the shaft, the location of
      the installation hole, etc.
      <br />
      <br />
      5. Click &quot;Insert&quot;. This will insert the selected motor or steering
      gear model into your Fusion 360 design.

      Technical Background:
      <br />
      Formerly known as FastRay software released in 1989, C4D was originally
      released on the Amiga platform, later renamed CINEMA 4D, and continues to be
      updated and enhanced in multiple versions.
      <br />
      With the continuous development of technology, C4D has become the software
      of choice for many excellent artists and film companies, and is widely used
      in advertising, film, industrial design and other fields.
      <br />
      Version Updates:
      <br />
      C4D 2024, for example, brings modeling improvements, powerful enhancements
      to the new unified simulation system, significant additions to the node
      editor, and the Redshift renderer as the default renderer, significantly
      improving the performance and efficiency of the software.
      <br />
      Application Cases:
      <br />
      C4D is prominent in all kinds of movies depicted and is valued by more and
      more film companies. At the same time, its application is also widely
      involved in advertising, industrial design and other fields, providing
      strong technical support for creators.

      Chamfering is an important part of modeling, which prevents our device from
      getting stuck on the objects we need to handle, and also reduces damage to
      the device and keeps the system up and running

      With the alignment function, the parts can be easily assembled because all
      the parts are rotated together on a common axis. Such a two-gear
      construction is much more reliable than a four-gear one because of the
      tolerances created by 3D printing.
