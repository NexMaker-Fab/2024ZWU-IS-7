          Appearance: Polyethylene plastics are usually milky white, odorless,
          odorless, non-toxic, and waxy particles with a dull surface.
          <br />
          Density: Different types of polyethylene have different densities. For
          example, LDPE has a lower density of about 0.918 g/cm³; The density of
          HDPE is higher, about 0.945~0.96 g/cm3.
          <br />
          Melting Point: The melting point also varies depending on the species.
          The melting point of LDPE is low, about 105~115 °C; HDPE, on the other
          hand, has a higher melting point, about 125~137°C.
          <br />
          Other characteristics: polyethylene plastic has excellent low
          temperature resistance (the lowest use temperature can reach -100~-70
          °C), good chemical stability, and can resist the erosion of most acids
          and alkalis (not resistant to acids with oxidizing properties). In
          addition, it also has excellent resistance to most domestic and
          industrial chemicals, insoluble in general solvents at room temperature,
          low water absorption, and excellent electrical insulation

          resin, while the low-pressure method is mainly used for the production
          of HDPE and LLDPE. These production processes require specific catalysts

          Sandblasting: This is a common post-processing method for metals. It
          involves propelling fine particles of sand or other abrasives at high
          speed onto the metal surface to smoothen it, remove surface
          imperfections, or create a specific texture. Sandblasting is often used
          for decorative finishes, rust removal, and preparation for painting or
          coating

          Flame Treatment: For some types of plastics, flame treatment is a
          post-processing method that improves the surface energy and wettability.
          A small flame is briefly applied to the plastic surface, changing its
          chemical composition and making it more receptive to coatings,
          adhesives, or inks. This method is often used on polypropylene (PP) and
          polyethylene (PE) plastics.

          Sanding: Sanding is an important step in the post-processing of wood to
          achieve a smooth, even surface. It involves the use of sanding tools or
          machines with abrasive materials to remove rough edges, bumps, or
          scratches from the surface of the wood. Grinding can be done manually or
          with power tools, depending on the size and complexity of the workpiece.
          After sanding, the wood can be further surface treated with dyes,
          varnishes, or paints.
