        >
          Appearance: Polyethylene plastics are usually milky white, odorless,
          odorless, non-toxic, and waxy particles with a dull surface.
          <br />
          Density: Different types of polyethylene have different densities. For
          example, LDPE has a lower density of about 0.918 g/cm³; The density of
          HDPE is higher, about 0.945~0.96 g/cm3.
          <br />
          Melting Point: The melting point also varies depending on the species.
          The melting point of LDPE is low, about 105~115 °C; HDPE, on the other
          hand, has a higher melting point, about 125~137°C.
          <br />
          Other characteristics: polyethylene plastic has excellent low
          temperature resistance (the lowest use temperature can reach -100~-70
          °C), good chemical stability, and can resist the erosion of most acids
          and alkalis (not resistant to acids with oxidizing properties). In
          addition, it also has excellent resistance to most domestic and
          industrial chemicals, insoluble in general solvents at room temperature,
          low water absorption, and excellent electrical insulation

          Packaging industry: polyethylene plastic is mainly used to make plastic
          wrap, vest plastic bags, plastic food bags, etc. Due to its non-toxic,
          tasteless and odorless characteristics, it is widely used in the field
          of food packaging.
          <br />
          Agriculture: It is used to make agricultural mulch film to increase soil
          temperature, maintain soil moisture, and promote crop growth.
          <br />
          Construction: In the construction sector, polyethylene plastic can be
          used to make waterproofing membranes, pipes, etc.
          <br />
          Others: In addition, polyethylene plastic is also used to make everyday

          LDPE is the most technologically mature method in the production of PE
          resin, while the low-pressure method is mainly used for the production
          of HDPE and LLDPE. These production processes require specific catalysts

        >
          High Specific Strength and High Specific Modulus:
          <br />
          The specific modulus of carbon fiber reinforced resin composites is 5
          times higher than that of steel and aluminum alloys, and the specific
          strength is also more than 3 times higher than that of steel and
          aluminum alloys.
          <br />
          This means it offers more strength and stiffness at a lower weight.
          <br />
          High fatigue resistance:
          <br />
          The fatigue limit of carbon fiber unsaturated polyester resin composites
          can reach 70% to 80% of their tensile strength, while that of metal
          materials is only 40% to 50%.
          <br />
          This makes it a significant advantage in applications where cyclic loads
          need to be subjected to long-term loads.
          <br />
          Strong fracture resistance:
          <br />
          Since a large number of independently existing carbon fibers are bonded
          into a whole by a ductile matrix, when some of the fibers break, the
          load is redistributed to the other unbroken fibers, preventing sudden
          failure.
          <br />
          Good vibration damping performance:
          <br />
          The high natural frequency of carbon fiber reinforced resin composites
          avoids resonance and the resulting early damage during operation.

          This is a common post-processing method for metals. It involves
          propelling fine particles of sand or other abrasives at high speed onto
          the metal surface to smoothen it, remove surface imperfections, or
          create a specific texture. Sandblasting is often used for decorative

            Sanding:
            <br />
            Sanding is an important step in the post-processing of wood to achieve
            a smooth, even surface. It involves the use of sanding tools or
            machines with abrasive materials to remove rough edges, bumps, or
            scratches from the surface of the wood. Grinding can be done manually
            or with power tools, depending on the size and complexity of the
            workpiece. After sanding, the wood can be further surface treated with
            dyes, varnishes, or paints.
