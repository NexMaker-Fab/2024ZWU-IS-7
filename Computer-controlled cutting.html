            1, understand all the operation manual: before using the equipment, to
            fully understand and master the relevant instruction manual. When new
            equipment is introduced, the operating manual of the equipment needs
            to be studied and understood in detail.
            <br />
            <br />
            2, keep the equipment clean: not only the machine tool itself, but
            also the working environment, should be kept tidy. Chips and debris
            should be cleaned up in a timely manner to avoid interfering with the
            operation of the machine or causing safety accidents.

            and coolant status is normal, if there is any problem, it should be
            replaced or supplemented in time.

            safety hazards brought about by the preventive protection measures
            should be taken.

                5, do not abuse the workbench: it is prohibited to use the machine
                tool workbench as other workbenches, such as temporary storage of
                miscellaneous items.
                <br />
                <br />
                6, safe operation: do not use compressed air to blow off the
                machine parts, machine surfaces, cabinets, controllers or the
                floor around the machine chips.
                <br />
                <br />
                7, pay attention to rest: prolonged operation of CNC machine tools
                may lead to fatigue, affecting judgment and operating ability.
                Therefore, proper rest is also an important measure to protect
                safety.

          CNC machine tool equipment improves productivity and product quality.
          Compared with traditional processing methods, CNC equipment is
          characterized by high precision and high efficiency. Through digital
          control, CNC equipment can accurately control each processing link,
          reduce human error and ensure the stability and consistency of product
          quality. This not only improves the production efficiency, but also
          reduces the scrap rate and saves cost for the enterprise.
          <br />
          Promoted the transformation and upgrading of the manufacturing industry.
          With the increasing demand for consumer personalization and
          diversification of products, the traditional processing methods have
          been unable to meet the market demand. And CNC equipment can realize the
          processing of complex shapes and fine features through programming and
          software control, providing strong support for the transformation and
          upgrading of the manufacturing industry. At the same time, the degree of
          intelligence and automation of CNC equipment is getting higher and
          higher, making the manufacturing industry better able to adapt to market
          changes and user needs.
          <br />
          It helps to improve the competitiveness of enterprises. In the context
          of globalized competition, the competitiveness of enterprises depends on
          the quality and innovation of products. And CNC equipment, as a core
          tool of modern industrial manufacturing, can help enterprises quickly
          respond to market changes and launch competitive products. At the same
          time, through the introduction of advanced CNC equipment and technology,
          enterprises can also improve their own technical level and research and
          development capabilities, so as to better respond to market challenges
          and opportunities.

            >
              1.Dimensional adaptability: CNC milling machines (machining centers)
              usually have a large workspace and flexible machining capabilities,
              which can adapt to the machining needs of gears of different sizes.
              Since you mentioned &quot;not very large gears&quot;, the machining
              range of CNC milling machines should be sufficient to meet your
              needs.
              <br />
              2.High precision: CNC milling machines use advanced CNC technology
              to achieve high-precision machining. Modern CNC machining accuracy
              can reach the micrometer level, which is crucial for the tooth
              profile accuracy and fitting accuracy of gears.
              <br />
              3.Material adaptability: CNC milling machines can process materials
              of various hardness, including metals, plastics, etc. You need to
              choose the appropriate cutting tool and machining parameters based
              on the material of the gear.
              <br />
              4.Processing efficiency: CNC milling machines have an automatic tool
              changing function (if equipped with a tool library), which can
              greatly improve processing efficiency. By writing appropriate
              machining programs, multiple machining steps of gears can be
              completed at once, reducing machining time and cost.

              <br />
              2.CNC system: Choose a stable and reliable CNC system to ensure
              machining accuracy and stability.
              <br />
              3.Tools and fixtures: Select appropriate cutting tools and fixtures

              quality and efficiency.
              <br />

            the steel, which can prevent further oxidation and corrosion of the
            steel, giving stainless steel excellent corrosion resistance.

              1. Preparation: Determine the cutting size, workpiece surface
              cleanliness and flatness, and choose suitable cutting machine and
              equipment.
              <br />
              <br />
              2. Setting parameters: Adjust the laser power, scanning speed, gas
              flow and other parameters according to the material thickness,
              material, cutting shape, processing requirements and other factors.
              <br />
              <br />
              3. Preheating and pre-melting: Before the laser beam irradiates the
              workpiece, inert gas is sprayed to the surface of the workpiece
              through the nozzle to increase the surface temperature and reduce
              the influence of the laser beam on the workpiece when cutting.
              <br />
              <br />
              4. Cutting and processing: The laser beam focuses on the surface of
              the workpiece, melting and vaporizing the stainless steel material
              through the action of high temperature and high energy to form the
              cutting opening.
              <br />
              <br />
              5. Cleaning and processing: Remove the iron filings, oxides and
              other impurities generated during the cutting process, and polish
              and paint the cutout to improve the surface quality.
