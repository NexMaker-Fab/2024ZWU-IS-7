          computers to perform the logical control function of the operation
          sequence of the equipment&#039;s trajectory and peripherals according to
          the control program stored in advance.

          As a result of the use of computers to replace the original hardware
          logic circuits composed of numerical control devices, so that the input
          operating instructions for storage, processing, arithmetic, logic
          judgment and other control functions can be achieved through the
          computer software to complete the processing of micro-commands generated
          by the servo drive device to drive the motor or hydraulic actuators to

        CNC machine tool equipment improves productivity and product quality.
        Compared with traditional processing methods, CNC equipment is
        characterized by high precision and high efficiency. Through digital
        control, CNC equipment can accurately control each processing link, reduce
        human error and ensure the stability and consistency of product quality.
        This not only improves the production efficiency, but also reduces the
        scrap rate and saves cost for the enterprise.
        <br />
        Promoted the transformation and upgrading of the manufacturing industry.
        With the increasing demand for consumer personalization and
        diversification of products, the traditional processing methods have been
        unable to meet the market demand. And CNC equipment can realize the
        processing of complex shapes and fine features through programming and
        software control, providing strong support for the transformation and
        upgrading of the manufacturing industry. At the same time, the degree of
        intelligence and automation of CNC equipment is getting higher and higher,
        making the manufacturing industry better able to adapt to market changes
        and user needs.
        <br />
        It helps to improve the competitiveness of enterprises. In the context of
        globalized competition, the competitiveness of enterprises depends on the
        quality and innovation of products. And CNC equipment, as a core tool of
        modern industrial manufacturing, can help enterprises quickly respond to
        market changes and launch competitive products. At the same time, through
        the introduction of advanced CNC equipment and technology, enterprises can
        also improve their own technical level and research and development
        capabilities, so as to better respond to market challenges and
        opportunities.

          1.Dimensional adaptability: CNC milling machines (machining centers)
          usually have a large workspace and flexible machining capabilities,
          which can adapt to the machining needs of gears of different sizes.
          Since you mentioned &quot;not very large gears&quot;, the machining
          range of CNC milling machines should be sufficient to meet your needs.
          <br />
          2.High precision: CNC milling machines use advanced CNC technology to
          achieve high-precision machining. Modern CNC machining accuracy can
          reach the micrometer level, which is crucial for the tooth profile
          accuracy and fitting accuracy of gears.
          <br />
          3.Material adaptability: CNC milling machines can process materials of
          various hardness, including metals, plastics, etc. You need to choose
          the appropriate cutting tool and machining parameters based on the
          material of the gear.
          <br />
          4.Processing efficiency: CNC milling machines have an automatic tool
          changing function (if equipped with a tool library), which can greatly
          improve processing efficiency. By writing appropriate machining
          programs, multiple machining steps of gears can be completed at once,
          reducing machining time and cost.

            <li>
              Strength and toughness: Medium carbon alloy steel has high strength
              and toughness, and can maintain shape and structural integrity when
              subjected to strong forces and collisions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wear resistance: Due to the addition of alloying elements, the wear
              resistance of medium carbon alloy steel is better than that of
              ordinary carbon steel, making it suitable for components that
              require long-term use.
            </li>
            <li>
              Workability: Medium carbon alloy steel has good malleability and
              machinability, and its properties can be changed through heat
              treatment or cold processing to adapt to different types of
              manufacturing processes.
