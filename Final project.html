              The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for Good Health and
              Wellbeing aim to ensure a healthy lifestyle and promote the
              well-being of people of all ages. This goal aims to eradicate a
              range of diseases and address various stubborn and emerging health
              issues, especially in today&#039;s 21st century where people&#039;s
              mental health issues are often overlooked. This is what we want to
              warn everyone about. Sometimes the pain caused by mental illness is
              even more difficult to recover.

              With the rise of self media and the emergence of rolling media, the
              dissemination of information has become more subjective, with
              various values and ideas flooding the entire network, making it
              difficult for everyone to distinguish between right and wrong. In
              addition, the accelerating pace of overall life in society has led
              to an increasing speed of media browsing, sometimes unconsciously
              acquiescing to online violence and accepting various negative
              thoughts.

              So we want to wake people up. Some negative comments on the
              internet, even a casual accusation or verbal abuse, and some
              opinions that only represent personal colors, accumulate little by
              little, and accumulate one sentence at a time, which can subtly
              affect a person. Even if you subconsciously want to delete or block
              it, it has already left an indelible impact in your mind, and
              eventually, unconsciously, your thoughts gradually become biased.

                are addicted to the internet are easily influenced by online
