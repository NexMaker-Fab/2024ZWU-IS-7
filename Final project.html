          With the rise of self-media and the emergence of rolling media, the
          spread of information has become more subjective, and various values
          ​​and ideas are flooding the entire network, making it difficult for
          everyone to distinguish between right and wrong. In addition, the
          current social situation of accelerated pace of life has made everyone
          &quot;scroll&quot; the media faster and faster, and sometimes they
          unconsciously acquiesce to online violence and various negative
          thoughts. When you browse this information, you think you can control
          your own thoughts, but in fact, you can&#039;t escape it anyway and will
          inevitably be affected by it.
          <br />
          We hope everyone can get out of this infinite scrolling.
